# Regression--Retail-Sales-Prediction-project

Regression-Retail Stores Prediction Capstone Project :

The primary objective of this project is to predict daily sales for a retail store chain using historical sales data and various related features. By developing an accurate sales prediction model, the store can optimize inventory, staffing, and promotional strategies to improve overall operational efficiency and profitability.

Problem statement :

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. Our main objective is to understand the data , analyze the key parameters and build a model .


Approach :

The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:
    Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
    Feature Engineering: Create new features that may influence sales.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.
    Modeling: Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict sales.
    Validation and Testing: Validate the model using unseen data and test its performance.
    Implementation: Deploy the model for practical use and continuous improvement.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :

EDA is a crucial step in understanding the underlying patterns in the data. The following steps were performed:
    Data Cleaning:
        Checked for missing values and imputed them appropriately.
        Converted date columns to datetime objects for easier manipulation.
        Removed or corrected any obvious errors or outliers in the data.
    Data Visualization:
        Sales Trends: Plotted sales over time to identify seasonal patterns, trends, and anomalies.
        Distribution Analysis: Examined the distribution of sales, customers, and other key variables.
        Correlation Analysis: Computed and visualized the correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.
    Feature Analysis:
        Day of the Week: Analyzed sales patterns based on the day of the week.
        Monthly Trends: Investigated how sales vary across different months and seasons.
        Promotions and Holidays: Assessed the impact of promotions and holidays on sales.


Methodology :

The methodology to build the sales prediction model includes the following steps:
    Data Preprocessing:
        Ensure all dates are in datetime format.
        Handle missing values for important features like competition details, promotion details, and distances.
        Cap outliers to reduce their impact on the model.
    Feature Engineering:
        Time-based Features: Extract day of the week, month, year, and season from the date.
        Lag Features: Create lag features to incorporate sales data from previous days.
        Rolling Statistics: Calculate rolling mean and standard deviation for sales over different windows.
        Promo Duration: Calculate the duration since the last promotion started.
        Holiday and Weekend Indicators: Create binary indicators for holidays and weekends.
    Model Building:
        Model Selection: Choose appropriate regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
        Training and Validation: Split the data into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance.
        Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
    Evaluation Metrics:
        Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
    Model Validation:
        Validate the model on a hold-out test set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
        Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness and stability of the model.
    Deployment:
        Once a satisfactory model is developed, deploy it for practical use.
        Set up a pipeline for continuous monitoring and updating of the model with new data.


Conclusion :

By implementing the steps outlined above, we aim to develop a reliable sales prediction model for the retail store chain. The key takeaways from the project are:
    Accurate Predictions: The model provides accurate daily sales predictions, helping the store manage inventory and staffing more effectively.
    Key Influencers: Identified important factors such as promotions, holidays, and seasonal trends that significantly impact sales.
    Business Optimization: The insights and predictions from the model enable the store to optimize business operations, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.
