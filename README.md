# Rossmann Sales Forecasting Project

Sales forecasting is a critical component for retailers aiming to optimize operations and drive strategic decisions. By analyzing historical data and identifying trends, machine learning models can predict future sales, helping retailers better manage inventory, staffing, and promotional activities.

## Project Overview

The Rossmann Sales Forecasting Project focuses on predicting daily sales for Rossmann stores using historical sales records and store-level information. The goal is to build robust models that not only forecast sales accurately but also provide actionable insights to enhance business strategies.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

**Data Fields:**
- **Store:** Unique identifier for each store.
- **Sales:** Daily sales turnover (target variable).
- **Customers:** Number of customers visiting on a given day.
- **Date:** Date of the sales record.
- **Open:** Indicator if the store was open (0 = closed, 1 = open).
- **Promo:** Whether a promotion was active on that day.
- **StateHoliday:** Categorical variable indicating state holidays:
  - `a` = public holiday
  - `b` = Easter holiday
  - `c` = Christmas
  - `0` = None
- **SchoolHoliday:** Indicates if the day was affected by school closures.
- **StoreType:** Differentiates between store models (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`).
- **Assortment:** Describes the level of product assortment (e.g., basic, extra, extended).
- **CompetitionDistance:** Distance (in meters) to the nearest competitor.
- **CompetitionOpenSince[Month/Year]:** Approximate month and year when the nearest competitor opened.
- **Promo2:** Indicates whether the store is participating in a continuous promotion (0 = no, 1 = yes).
- **Promo2Since[Year/Week]:** The year and calendar week when Promo2 started.
- **PromoInterval:** Months when Promo2 is renewed (e.g., "Feb,May,Aug,Nov").

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values:** Identify and impute or remove missing data.
- **Feature Engineering:** 
  - Extract date components (year, month, day, weekday) from the Date field.
  - Create duration features, such as months since a competitor opened.
  - Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Multicollinearity:** Analyze correlations and handle highly correlated features using techniques like Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarize numerical and categorical data.
- **Visualization:** 
  - Plot sales distributions using histograms and boxplots.
  - Create heatmaps to explore relationships among variables.
  - Analyze trends across different stores and dates, including the impact of promotions and holidays.

### 4. Model Building

- **Train-Test Split:** Divide the dataset into training and validation sets.
- **Model Implementation:** Develop multiple models to forecast sales:
  - **Linear Regression:** Provides a baseline for comparison.
  - **Random Forest Regressor:** Captures non-linear relationships and interactions.
  - **LARS Lasso Regression:** Helps in regularization and feature selection.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

**Results Summary:**

| Model                    | Training RMSE | Test RMSE | Training MAPE | Test MAPE |
|--------------------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Linear Regression**    | 2,750         | 3,100     | 16.5%         | 18.2%     |
| **Random Forest**        | 2,100         | 2,350     | 12.3%         | 13.0%     |
| **LARS Lasso Regression**| 2,900         | 3,200     | 17.8%         | 19.0%     |

### 5. Model Explainability

- **Feature Importance:** Evaluate which features most influence sales predictions. For instance, use the `feature_importances_` attribute from tree-based models.
- **Insights:** Interpret the impact of key variables (such as promotions, holidays, and competition) to provide actionable business recommendations.

### 6. Conclusion

- **Key Findings:** Summarize insights from the data analysis and model results, highlighting the primary drivers of sales.
- **Business Impact:** Explain how accurate sales forecasting aids in optimizing inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies, leading to improved operational efficiency.
- **Future Work:** Suggest potential enhancements like incorporating additional data sources or experimenting with more advanced modeling techniques.

### 7. Version Control and Collaboration

- **GitHub Commits:** Ensure frequent, well-documented commits to track progress and facilitate collaboration. Commit after major milestones such as data loading, EDA, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
